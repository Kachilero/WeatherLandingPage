# WeatherLandingPage

## Current Progresss

Tracking the progress of the technical requirements

1. 80% - Using bootstrap shortcuts this
2. 100% - Both are required before form can be submitted
3. 25% - Sign up fires but is not "tracked"
4. 0% - Documentation has not started
5. 100% - All required fields are displayed

This projects objective is to create a weather landing page that will get people to sign up for a service.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## Technical Requirements

1. It should be responsive
2. ZIP code and acceptance of the terms of service are mandatory
3. Track clicks of sign up
4. Document any design or functionality decision made to maximize conversion
5. The page needs to pull information from an API and display the following information:
    - The user's city and state.
    - The current temperature
    - The high and low temperature
    - An icon of the current weather conditions
    - A short description of the weather conditions

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
